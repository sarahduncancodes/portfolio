This tool is placed within the UK government's official apprenticeships site. This site provides inspiration to aspiring apprentices, and motivation for employers to hire apprentices. Hence, the goal of this Return on Investment tool, placed within the employer-aimed part of the site, is to motivate potential employers with a combination of non-financial and financial benefits. ",

Currently there is only one option for the user to state a preference on, however this site is dynamic. So, as new types of notifications become optional to the user and these notifications are added to the database, they will show up on the interface too. The Apprenticeship Service uses varying contact-channels from email to text message to mail. This site is able to cater for all of these. This project was my first project as a new apprentice (Feb to June of 2022). It was very exciting to be able to log in to my own apprentice account and see something I built.",

Due to tight deadlines the minimum-viable-service was rushed out the door and user-research was limited. This iteration aimed to get a refreshed insight into user's thoughts about the product and incorporate the findings into a design for a more user-focused product. I worked closely with the design team, made up of a User Researcher, User Interaction Designer, and Content Designer, to implement this design. I coordinated regularly with the Business Analyst and Product Owner in my delivery team too.",
